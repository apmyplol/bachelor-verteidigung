  abstract = {This treatise deals with modern theory of functional equations in several variables and their applications to mathematics, information theory, and the natural, behavioural and social sciences. The authors have chosen to emphasize applications, though not at the expense of theory, so they have kept the prerequisites to a minimum; the reader need be familiar only with calculus and elementary algebra, and have a basic knowledge of Lebesgue integration. Where, for certain applications, more advanced topics are needed, the authors have included references and explained the results used. Moreover, the book has been designed so that the chapters can be read almost independently of each other, enabling a selection of material to be chosen for introductory and advanced courses. At the end of each chapter are included exercises and further results, some 400 in all, which extend the material presented in the text and also test it. The history of functional equations is well documented in a final chapter which is complemented by an encyclopedic bibliography running to over 1600 items.},

The hypothesis was strongly confirmed by both the direct and the comparative judgments.

  abstract = {This chapter focuses on empirical structures, with an ordering attribute, leading to numerical or geometric representations. A historical sketch of physical, behavioral, and social science measurement until 1950 is followed by modern approaches to representational measurement in the behavioral sciences. Among these structures are: difference, additive conjoint, averaging, and non-additive concatenation and conjoint structures. Derived measurement is described by distributive linkages between two structures with a common attribute and is exemplified by physical, utility, and psychophysical examples. Two mathematical results are needed in each case: the existence of structure-preserving numerical representations and their uniqueness. The latter has been analyzed generically. Using these ideas, models of magnitude estimation and production are summarized. The nature of axiomatization is discussed in terms of types of logical languages, the role of certain second-order axioms, and issues of consistency and independence of axioms. Important results about the impossibility of simple axiomatizations of classes of finite structures are described along with mention of some problems.},
